This project demonstrates the Producer-Consumer problem using multithreading in Java. The Producer-Consumer problem is a classic synchronization problem where two threads (a producer and a consumer) share a common buffer. The producer generates data and adds it to the buffer, while the consumer removes data from the buffer for processing. Proper synchronization ensures there are no race conditions or deadlocks.
